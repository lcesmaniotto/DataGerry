Bugfixes
--------

-  Object Links are now deleted when one of the objects is deleted

   special control “Reference” is now a required field. When this field

   configurations
-  The overview of selection fields now display correctly the
   select-option label instead of the select-option-value
-  Fixed various errors when opening object logs

   categories overview
-  Fixed an error occurring when closing the “Add Link” popup in the
   object overview
-  Fixed an issue where the values of fields (except name and label) of
   controls in type config were not saved in the database
-  Fixed a bug where subcategories were not accessible when the parent
   category got deleted
-  Fixed “Copy to clipboard” action for select fields taking the option
   value instead of the option label
-  Fixed a bug causing an application crash when adding an object link
   in the “Add link” popup but not providing a value
-  Fixed a bug where the status message popups in the top right corner
   could not be closed
-  Fixed an issue where sometimes the “Root”-Location was not
   automatically created in the database
-  Fixed an issue with basic auth where it didn’t work as intended
-  Fixed a bug where an error wa shown although a type was successfully
   exported
-  Fixed all tabs of object logs (Settings => Object Logs) where wrong
   data was loaded or not loaded at all
-  Fixed all tabs of object logs (Settings => Object Logs) where various
   errors occurred
-  Fixed the “Cleanup”-Button for all object logs (Settings => Object
   Logs) which should now work

| 

Changes
-------

DATAGerry Assistant

-  Created types are now placed in categories instead of being added
   plain
-  Added predefined section templates to several types which can be
   created via the assistant

| 

General

-  When an object is deleted, all corresponding object links will be
   removed. Additionally the object reference will be removed from all
   other objects referencing the deleted object
-  Removed the info box in the type overview
-  Moved the status message boxes in the top right corner down to not
   overlap the buttons like Settings, Logout etc.
-  Fields and section identifiers are now getting an UUID instead of a
   random number
-  In the object list table an object’s **View Mode** can now be
   accessed by clicking once into the row and the **Edit Mode** can be
   accessed by double clicking the row of the object
-  When cloning a type, the sections and fields will receive new IDs if
   required (global section templates won’t get new IDs)

| 

Frontend Changes

-  Several package bumps in preparation to upgrade the codebase to
